As a protest against certain marriage and divorce laws, the absurdity of which is portrayed with a satiric pen, “The Living Corpse” is a most effective document.</p><p>SUCH IS LIFE. A Play in five Acts, by Frank Wedekind, Author of “The Awakening of Spring,” etc. Cloth, gilt top, raw edge, Net, $1.25, by Mail, $1.34. Whatever Wedekind's theme may be, it is always sure to be treated in a strikingly original fashion. In “<em>Such is Life_” it is _Regality and Kingship</em>. Though the <em>locale</em> is mediaeval Italy, the scene might as well have been laid at the present day, but this was, perhaps, too dangerous. While satire runs as an undercurrent throughout, the play is primarily one of tense dramatic situations and a clearly outlined plot, full of color and action. Portions of the play are written in verse—verse that runs with almost Elizabethan fire and impetuosity.</p><p>MODERN AUTHORS' SERIES:</p></div> </div>
