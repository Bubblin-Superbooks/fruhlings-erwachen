Fehrendorf, I tell you, is a gibbering idiot. The last time, I trod on one of his tubes. He wiped his brush on my hair. I fetched him a box on the ear. He threw his palette at my head.

He swore amnesty, and—and then kissed me promptly and frightfully, frightfully, I tell you.</p><p>Moritz.</p><p>Where do you spend the night when you stop in town?</p><p>Ilse.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Yesterday we were at Nohl's.——The day before</p></div> </div>
