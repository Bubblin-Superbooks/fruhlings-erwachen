<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">salutat! Maiden, maiden, why dost thou press thy knees together?——Why now of all times?——In face of the inscrutable eternity?——A movement and I will spare thy life!——A womanly emotion, a sign of passion, of sympathy, maiden!——I will frame thee in gold, and hang thee over my bed! Doest thou not guess that only thy chastity begets my debauchery?——Woe, woe, unto the inhuman ones!——</p><p>One always perceives that they received an exemplary education——It is just so with me.</p><p>“Have you prayed to-night, Desdemona?”</p><p>My heart contracts,——madness!——St. Agnes also died for her reserve and was not half as naked as thou!——Another kiss upon thy blooming body——upon thy childish swelling breast—upon thy sweetly rounded—thy cruel knees——</p><p>“It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul, Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars! It is the cause!”——</p></div> </div>
