He will break under restraint; the most frightful examples will be before his eyes!——And if I see him again——O, God, O, God, that joyous heart——his clear laughter——all, all,——his childish resolution to fight courageously for good and righteousness——oh, this morning sky, how I cherished it light and pure in his soul as my highest good——Hold me to account if the sin cries for expiation! Hold me to account! Do with me what you will! I will bear the guilt.——But keep your frightful hand off the boy.</p><p>Herr Gabor.</p><p>He has gone wrong!</p><p>Frau Gabor.</p><p>He has not gone wrong!</p><p>Herr Gabor.</p></div> </div>
